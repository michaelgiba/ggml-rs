## ggml-rs

A work in progress implementation of rust bindings to ggml (https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) a c/c++ tensor library that has been 
used recently for portable inference of LLM on small devices. These bindings are adapated from a LLAMA implementation which used
ggml under the hood (https://github.com/setzer22/llama-rs/tree/main/llama-rs)
